    Recieves time-bin photons and passes them on to detectors. When detectors have been triggered
    at time-bin separated times, it notifies BSMNode and heralds memory entanglement.

        name (str): label for BSM instance
        timeline (Timeline): timeline for simulation
        detectors (List[Detector]): list of attached photon detection devices
        phase_error (float): phase error applied to polarization qubits (unused)
        encoding (str): 'time_bin', used in 'BSM' class to ensure recieved
            photon is of the same encoding type
        trigger_times (List[int]): time-ordered list of recent times detectors clicked
        signal_values (List[bool]): time-ordered list of booleans of whether recently arrived photons
            that caused detector clicks where signals or not.
        detector_hits (List[int]): time-ordered list of numbers of recently triggered detectors.
        
        
        ######### NOT USING THE REST OF THESE FOR NOW
        last_res (List[Int]): pair of ints, initially set to [-1,-1], where the
            first int is the time of the last time 'trigger' was called and the
            second int is the detector (0 or 1) that caused said trigger
        early_early (int): total count of photon pairs the device measured as
            both being early
        early_late (int): total count of photon pairs the device measured as
            photon1 being early and photon2 being late
        late_early (int): total count of photon pairs the device measured as
            photon2 being late and photon2 being early
        late_late (int): total count of photon pairs the device measured as
            both being late
        desired_state (bool): true if photons are |early,late> or |late,early>,
            else false
        trigger_count (int): count how many times trigger function was called
        appropriate_time_photon_count (int): counts how many photons cause a
            trigger at roughly the bin_separation time from the previous photon
            arrival. this should only be the late photons in an early+late pair
        approved_state_invalid_time_photon_count (int): counts how many photons
            that come from an early+late pair (valid) arrive at an invalid time,
            meaning not a bin_separation time away from the previous photon.
            this should only be the early photons in said pairs.
        invalid_state_photon_count (int): counts how many photons that come from
            an invalid pair (late+late or early+early) arrive at an invalid
            time. this should be half of them, as the detector can register
            one photon at a time and they will arrive at the same time and same
            detector (by HOM effect).
