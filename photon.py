"""Model for single photon in heterogenous network simulation. # NOTE HM DONE whole file

This module defines the HetPhoton class for tracking individual photons.
HetPhoton class inherits directly from Photon class, and simply adds a few attribute.
Photons may be encoded directly with polarization or time bin schemes, or may herald the encoded state of single atom memories.

    Attributes:
        name (str): label for photon instance.
        wavelength (float): wavelength of photon (in nm).
        location (Entity): current location of photon.
        encoding_type (Dict[str, Any]): encoding type of photon (as defined in encoding module).
        quantum_state (Union[int, Tuple[complex]]): quantum state of photon.
            If `use_qm` is false, this will be a QuantumState object.
            Otherwise, it will be an integer key for the quantum manager.
        is_null (bool): defines whether photon is real or a "ghost" photon (not detectable but used in memory encoding).
                        if True, then it is a "ghost" photon
        loss (float): similarly defined for memory encoding, used to track loss and improve performance.
            Does not need to be utilized for all encoding schemes.
        use_qm (bool): determines if photon stores state locally (False) or uses timeline quantum manager (True).
        qfc_noise_count (int): number of noise photons from a QFC encapsulated in this object (in the same mode).
        qfc_transducer_count (int): number of noise photons from a transducer encapsulated in this object (in the same mode).
        contains_signal (bool): whether this photon object contains a signal photon or not.
        only_early (bool): whether this photon only has the early bin of a time bin encoding, due to decoherence during generation.
