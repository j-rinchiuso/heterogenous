"""Models for photon detection devices.

This module models a single photon detector (SPD) for measurement of individual photons.
It also defines a QSDetector class,
which combines models of different hardware devices to measure photon states in different bases.
QSDetector is defined as an abstract template and as implementations for polarization and time bin qubits.

        dark_count (float): average number of false positive detections per second.

        photon_counter (int): counts number of detection events.
