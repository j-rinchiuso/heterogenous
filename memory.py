"""Models for simuulation of memory components in a heterogenous quantum network. # NOTE HM done

This model builds on SeQUeNCe's memory module, but adds an altered memory array class (HetMemoryArray), and two new memory class (Yb and uW).
HetMemoryArray inhereits from MemoryArray with all the same functionality except enabling alternative types of memories.
NOTE: If MemoryArray would allow component_templates or memo_type inputs, we wouldn't need a separate class for HetMemoryArray.
Yb and uW both inherit from Memory, but have different parameters and methods to reflect their physical differences.
